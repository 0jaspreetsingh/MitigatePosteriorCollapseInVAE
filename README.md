# MitigatePosteriorCollapseInVAE
The study involved training a Beta-VAE model with a latent representation size of 32 and varying the beta values of 10 and 20 to evaluate their impact on reconstruction accuracy and disentanglement of the latent representation. It was found that increasing the beta value from 10 to 20 led to a focus on disentangling the latent representation but at the expense of reconstruction accuracy. The higher beta value also resulted in posterior collapse, leading to poor performance and inadequate generation of new data. The beta value of 10 was found to be more suitable as it achieved a balance between disentanglement and reconstruction accuracy without posterior collapse. To address posterior collapse, additional regularization can be added to the latent representation, changing the model architecture, or modifying the training procedure to encourage more meaningful latent representations.
